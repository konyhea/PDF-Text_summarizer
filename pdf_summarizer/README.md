# Building a Simple Summarizer Using React JS and OpenAI LLM

This project demonstrates how to build a simple text summarization app using **React JS** and OpenAI's powerful Large Language Models (LLMs). With OpenAI's API, you can power applications capable of advanced text manipulation and summarization.

## Features

- Summarize text input or uploaded PDF documents.
- Powered by OpenAI's state-of-the-art LLMs.
- Easy-to-use React-based UI.
